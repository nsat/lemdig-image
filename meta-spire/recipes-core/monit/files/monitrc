##
## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
set daemon 10
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file
#
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
#
### Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
### Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By
### default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
set idfile /media/sd1/.monit.id
#
### Set the location of the Monit pid file which stores the pid file for the
### Monit instance. The pid is stored on Monit start.
#
set pidfile /var/run/monit.pid
#
### Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
### on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
### the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
### the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
### state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
set statefile /media/sd1/.monit.state
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using a comma separator. By default Monit uses port 25 - it is
## possible to override this with the PORT option.
#
# set mailserver mail.bar.baz,               # primary mailserver
#                backup.bar.baz port 10025,  # backup mailserver on port 10025
#                localhost                   # fallback relay
#
#
## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available.
## If you want to keep the alerts for later delivery retry, you can use the
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
set eventqueue
    basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
    slots 1000          # optionally limit the queue size
#
#
## Send status and events to M/Monit (for more informations about M/Monit
## see http://mmonit.com/).
#
#set mmonit http://spire:spire@10.2.0.250:8080/collector
#    and register without credentials

set httpd port 2812 and
    allow localhost     # allow localhost to connect to the server and

include /etc/monit.d/*.cfg
